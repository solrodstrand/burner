    <p>There is a popular poster on a forum that I visit who dispenses excellent advice with elegance and eloquence. In one of my favorite posts of his, another poster was speaking about a certain kind of ennui after having reached a pinnacle of sexual success. The all-star poster responded to this with a recommendation of focusing on <strong>the life of the mind.</strong></p>

<p>His premise is that sexual pleasures are a part of the life of the body, and that for a man who is sensitive, intelligent and self-aware, the life of the body is necessarily limited. A man who is no longer in his full youth should recognize the life of the body’s boundaries, and he ought to then turn his primary focus and energies toward the life of the mind where the font of variety and interest is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>The life of the body should not be ignored, but in order to live a better and more interesting life, it must take a secondary role.</p>

<p>This call to cultivate the life of the mind resonates with me because it speaks to my ‘higher faculties’ even though I’ve largely neglected to cultivate them with the diligence they require. The life of the mind and all that it involves–</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ability to concentrate</li>
  <li>the ability to maintain a level head</li>
  <li>creativity</li>
  <li>powers of reason</li>
  <li>problem solving</li>
</ul>

<p>–requires a lot of diligence and an unremitting motion of applying one’s self.</p>

<p>One thing truly holding me back are the ravages of a depression that overtook me in my mid-20’s. My life has been organized to a large extent around managing this mental sickness ever since. I am limited in my energy levels, limited in the employment that I can take without having my mind cave, and I am socially weakened due to the way it clouds brain.</p>

<p>It is generally under control and the darkest days, I believe, are behind me.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, and personal shortcomings and concerns notwithstanding, <strong>the life of the mind</strong> is what appeals to my psyche and spirit, and there appears no better route toward the good life than the development of the mind as a central part of one’s life.</p>
